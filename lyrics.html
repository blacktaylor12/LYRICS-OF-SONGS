        Who's your guy?  (Spyro)
        Na only me walahi
        See as we dey like beans & rice!
        I will never leave your side (I will never ever go)
        I dedicate my time..... to you my guy

        Even if the road rough i no mind
        'Cause you be my Gee... for life
        Yeah I'm feeling good tonight
        Cause i dey here with my guy
        I get plenty for my mind

        But right now am with my guy
        I no dey fear them gat my back
        Shey you don see my formation
        Agbalabi combination
        Sight the.... inspiration
        And we don get concentration

        When my guys dem wole o
        Bad energy far away o
        I thank God for my real gees
        Good friends no be money
        Who is your guy? (Spyro)
        Na only me walahi

        See as we dey like beans & rice
        I will never leave your side (I will never ever go)
        I dedicate my life to you my guy
        Even if the road rough i no mind
        Cause you be my Gee for life
